# Mini Project 1 - An Animated App using App Inventor
Create an app with animation behaviour similar to but more complex than that found in MoleMash (http://www.appinventor.org/AndroidMash-steps) and Pong (http://www.appinventor.org/pong-steps). Functionally, the app should have the following:
1. objects that move over time (e.g., a spaceship flying across the screen)
2. objects that move or are transformed in reaction to end-user activities (e.g., OrientationSensor to control movement)
3. objects that (dis-)appear in reaction to end-user activities (e.g., an asteroid disappearing when shot)
4. use of conditional (if) blocks
5. use of collidedWith and edgeReached blocks
6. uses at least one procedure

# Space-Shooter-MobileApplication

I have created a space shooter game on App Inventor where Objects used in the game are Spaceship, bullet and asteroids.

Rules of the game are as follows
The user needs to hit asteroid through the bullets to gain a point. After the accumulation of 5 points the user wins and the game ends. 
When the user clicks on the spaceship the bullet starts to fire and the bullet should hit the asteroid. 
After the bullet hits the asteroid the bullet disappears and appears when the user taps on the spaceship. 
If the user taps on asteroid instead of the spaceship the user is penalized by 1 point and a speech notifies the user it is a penalty and the score is deducted
After the user scores 5 points the game ends and a notification message appears stating that "GAME OVER. CLICK ON RESET GAME TO START OVER" and the spaceship and asteroid disappears
Once the user clicks on Reset Game the spaceship and asteroid appear on the screen for a new game.
The user can rotate the phone and play as well
